                    Global Scope
                    The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.

                    <p>
                        Block Scope
Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

                        Javascript is a single-threaded programming language, this implies that all the code can only be run on one thread, and processes or requests can be run concurrently with ease and also eliminate the need to create more threads thanks to the event loop.Since Javascript is single-threaded and synchronous in nature, you might now be wondering how am I able to make async calls with Javascript if the language is synchronous, well that's thanks to the event loop, its a mechanism built into Javascript and we are going to be going over through it today.
                        How it works The event loop has one main function, at every tick of the javascript run process, it looks at the callstack and checks if any function or activity is available, if none is available it pushes items from the queue into it, then that operation is later run on the stack. A gif is better than a thousand worlds.
